 <h1>The Best Movies according to Vic</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 of all time</h2>
 <hr />
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>I love Morgan Freeman's acting on this.  It also shows that in life there are liars and cheats </p>

<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p> One of my favourites.  Sad but very inspiring</p>

<h3>Cry My Beloved Country</h3>
<p>when you have lived in the apartheid time in South Africa you understand what it's like. James Earl Jones was an amazing actor</p>
