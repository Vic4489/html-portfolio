<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Vicky Shasha-Ndlovu.  Life has not always been easy for me but I have always wanted to work in computers. I bought a programming course in 2019 when I was at my lowest but at that time I was not in the right space to learn.  In December 2024 I reached another milestone in my life.  This is when I decided that a change in my career path and I want to create apps and things.<p>That's when I looked online and people said I should learn full stack development.  When I looked up the course in Udemy, that's when I found that I did buy this course over 5 years ago and it is still available to me.  I started on the 29th December 2024, which is exactly 14 days after my birthday.  I believe a lot in destiny and so far I am enjoying learning this new skill and also doing it on my pace </p>
